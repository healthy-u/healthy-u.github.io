HealthyU is a social run tracker/pedometer Android app for college campuses that will give points to users based on their activity that will be used to rank them against their fellow classmates and other colleges.

Through partnerships with universities or local business, prizes can be awarded to the top users to create an even greater incentive to reach the top of the leaderboards. Additionally, these competitions can be team based. By linking to facebook, these teams can be divided in such a way to have students have their friends on their team to push each other to be more active. The aggregate activity of the campus will be tallied and displayed on an intercollegiate leader where various campuses compete against each other to be the most active.

HealthyU is being develped as part of the University of Alabama''s CS 495 class and is being designed, developed, and released by four students: Dustin Bennett, Tyler Henson, Ryan Mitchum, and Lu Zhang.
